# firstproject

Hi.

This is my getting started with Flutter.

I'm learning a new technology to complement my developer stack.
Right now I work mainly with CodeIgniter 4, but it was time to start learning a new language/framework, so I chose the Flutter side of the force and I hope it gets the job done.
